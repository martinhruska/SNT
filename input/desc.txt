  - sm - single mode
  - j30 - 30 tasks
  - 11 - combination of parameters values, described in paper to PSP lib.
       - there are four values for RF and RS and three for NC.
       - numbers (in this case 11) denotes particular combination of these parameters (eg. NC[2,] RF[3],RS[3])
  - 10 - number of replication [1..10] for given a parameters 

Generally, we se particular combinations of parameters and ProGen generates an instance of a problem. So we need to
make permutation for a given configuration because always returns a different instance (e.g., precendence relation can differs).

due date - earliest makespan (i think that it is lower bound).
MPM-time - metra potential method (same as due date).
tardcost - cost of tardiness of a project.
horizon - upper bound, sum of all durations
